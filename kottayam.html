          Illikal Kallu
          <br>
          One of the most popular tourist destinations in Kottayam district is Illickal Kallu, situated on a majestic hill called Illickal Mala. 

          There are numerous mountain streams in Illickal Mala, which is 6,000 ft above sea level,
           and they flow down to form the serene Meenachil River. Each of the three hills has a peculiar shape. 
           One of them resembles a mushroom and hence, its name 'Kuda Kallu' (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has a 
           small hunch on the side and is therefore called as 'Koonu Kallu' (hunchback rock). The third one is called Illickal
            Kallu as it derives its name from the mountain itself. 
          The steep rock on the top of the hill has a part of its peak shorn off.
